**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 0: August 12, 2018 
**Today's Progress**: Finished some freecodecamp applied accessibility challenges. Also worked on one of the projects, the tribute page.
**Thoughts**: The part that takes the longest is doing the research. However, I know that once i get a job as a software developer, this won't be much of a problem
